# fraps-average

This application is primarily useful if you're working with old versions of fraps where FPS average isn't easy to get. The logic is fairly blunt, dumb and bruteforce, also this is not suitable for long videos, I'd recommend not to exceed 1 minute. 

How it works:

- Once you start the application it asks you the enter full path to a video file
- Application scans each frame of the video, finds the FPS counter
- takes each number and at the end calculates the average.
- prints out the result.

Is this smart? No. Does it work? Probably, yes. 

I use this application with Max Payne intro and I only tested it with this intro. I don't know how it would behave with different videos (especially if there are other numbers visible in the video).

Use with caution, I'm not responsible if you mess things up but please tell me if that happens. Not that I can help you but I would like to know how did you manage damage something with this application.
